# OpenGL_Game
a simple game in 3D programmed directly with OpenGL

Models can be created with Blender and then exported as OBJ format for example. Also FBX format works great for me.
The ModelConverter Tool import the Vertices, Indices and the Material from the file(s)(in case of OBJ an extra MTL file will be created and needed
using the Open-Asset-Importer-Library. The tool then exports the data into a custom BMF file. where the data can be loaded by the game faster.

The Game itself use the libary SDL to create a window and OpenGL-context. Also the libary GLEW is used to get the current OpenGL functions.
For the mathematics (Matrices and Vectors) the libary OpenGL Mathematics is used.

On the Graphics Card side i use the shader programming language GLSL
https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_(GLSL)

For importing Textures and Fonts i use the STB Libary.

As Mapfiles i use the XML format. To parse them i use the tinyxml2 Library.

for playing audio the irrKlang-Libary is used.

The idea and the knowlegde for this project did i get from this german youtube OpenGL tutorial playlist:

On of the first versions that had just material properties and no textures
![](Images/screenshot1.png)
Implementation of textures, skybox, colored hud elements.
That version had also already simple physic, the boxes in the middle are standing on top of each other
![](Images/screenshot5.png)
Transparent textures with alpha blending and arrows that have collision with the object and get stuck in it
![](Images/screenshot8.png)
A couple of testballs to test different textures and material properties. Metal (left in the middle) doesnt look well with the phong shading model.
It is missing reflections of the world. Also the game renders shadows with the shadow mapping technique
