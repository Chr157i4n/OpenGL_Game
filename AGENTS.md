## Code Navigation

ALWAYS use OpenCodeRAG tools before reading or editing:
- **Search first** — `search_semantic(query)` instead of grep/glob
- **Skeleton before read** — `get_file_skeleton(filePath)` then read specific lines
- **Usages before edit** — `find_usages(symbolName)` before modifying any symbol
- **Images via describe** — `describe_image(filePath, systemPrompt?)` — never read raw bytes
- **Recall quirks** — `recall_quirks(query)` when you hit a known pitfall
- **Add quirks** — `add_quirk(content)` when you discover a non-obvious fact
- **Fix quirks** — `update_quirk(id, ...)` / `delete_quirk(id)` when a stored quirk is outdated or wrong

If no results, run `opencode-rag index`.

### Decision tree — ALWAYS follow this order
1. User mentions code behavior/architecture → `search_semantic(query)`
2. User mentions a file path → `get_file_skeleton(filePath)` THEN `read` on specific lines
3. User mentions a function/class/variable to edit → `find_usages(symbolName)` THEN `search_semantic` THEN `edit`
4. User asks a code question → `search_semantic` to gather context before answering
5. User asks about an image or visual asset → `describe_image(filePath)` (optionally pass `systemPrompt` to focus on specific features) to retrieve its generated description, then optionally `search_semantic` for related code
6. You encounter an error or need to recall a known pitfall → `recall_quirks(query)`
7. You discover a non-obvious fact or workaround → `add_quirk(content)` to persist it for future sessions
8. A recalled quirk is outdated or wrong → `update_quirk(id, ...)` to fix it, or `delete_quirk(id)` if it no longer applies

### Proactive triggers — you MUST call these tools when
- User asks about code behavior, architecture, or implementation details
- User asks to edit, refactor, or fix code — call `find_usages` first
- User references files or functions you haven't read yet
- User says "find", "search", "look up", "where is", "how does"
- User refers to an image, screenshot, diagram, or visual asset
- Before answering ANY code-related question, retrieve context first
- Before reading ANY file, call `get_file_skeleton` to orient first

### Anti-patterns — NEVER do these
- Reading full files without calling `get_file_skeleton` first (wastes tokens)
- Editing a function without calling `find_usages` first (breaks call sites)
- Answering code questions without calling `search_semantic` first (you guess at behavior)
- Using `grep`/`glob` when `search_semantic` would find the answer faster
- Treating image files as text — use `describe_image` instead of reading raw bytes
- Using `npx opencode-rag quirk` shell commands instead of the built-in quirk tools (`add_quirk` / `recall_quirks` / `update_quirk` / `delete_quirk`) (the tools are faster, already loaded in-process, and go through the trust monitor)

### MANDATORY quirk capture rules — you MUST call `add_quirk` when
- A build, test, or type-check command fails and you resolve it
- You discover an undocumented library constraint, peer dep, or workaround
- You learn an environment-specific requirement (OS, tool version, etc.)
- You make a design decision that future sessions should remember
- You resolve a gotcha that cost more than one attempt

### MANDATORY quirk hygiene — you MUST call `update_quirk` or `delete_quirk` when
- A stored quirk is outdated, wrong, or has been fixed — update it or delete it instead of adding a contradicting duplicate
- NEVER finish a coding session without adding quirks for resolved errors.

### Long-running commands
Long-running commands:
- Any `shell` call expected to take more than 30s MUST set `background: true` (returns immediately; the session is notified on completion) or set an explicit `timeout` (ms).
- Default foreground timeout: 120000ms. Never run builds/tests/indexes in the foreground beyond 30s; if a call is already running, press Ctrl+B to background it (OpenCode: `session.background`).
- OpenCodeRAG measures foreground shell duration and records a quirk when a call exceeds the threshold, so repeated foreground runs become visible.
